# Pathfinding Visualizer

The Pathfinding Visualizer project is an interactive tool built using React, designed to demonstrate the functionality of Dijkstra's algorithm in finding the shortest path in a grid. This visualizer provides an intuitive and engaging way to understand the inner workings of one of the most renowned algorithms in computer science.

## Key Features

- **Shortest Path Visualization:** Watch as Dijkstra's algorithm dynamically finds and displays the shortest path between a starting point and a destination.
- **Interactive Grid:** Users can easily add or remove walls in the grid, forcing the algorithm to find new paths that navigate around obstacles.
- **Real-Time Updates:** As walls are added or removed, the visualizer instantly recalculates the shortest path, providing immediate feedback and a deeper understanding of the algorithm's behavior.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Developed with React, the visualizer offers a seamless and responsive user experience, allowing users of all skill levels to interact and learn.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Leveraged for building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Implemented to ensure efficient and accurate pathfinding even in the presence of multiple obstacles.

This Pathfinding Visualizer is an excellent educational tool for students and enthusiasts looking to explore the principles of pathfinding algorithms and their applications in real-world scenarios.
